## Project Description

A dedicated To-Do List and Employee Collaboration Application will be developed to
streamline task management, internal communication, and employee oversight
within the company. This application will be tailored for organizational use and will
ensure that team productivity is enhanced while administrative control is maintained.
All functionalities will be designed with scalability and user role separation in mind.
Distinct user roles will be defined, and access will be granted based on those roles.
Employees will be categorized into roles such as Admin, Manager, and Employee.
Specific permissions will be assigned to each role to ensure data security and
accountability. Full access to user activities, including chats and task progress, will
be granted to Admins. Managers will be allowed to create tasks, assign
responsibilities, and monitor progress, while Employees will be given access to only
their assigned tasks and communication channels relevant to their teams.
Tasks will be created, assigned, and tracked within the platform. Each task will be
described with details such as title, description, due date, and priority level. Tasks will
be marked with statuses like "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Completed," and changes
in status will be recorded automatically. Reminders and deadline alerts will be
triggered as per predefined schedules to ensure that no task deadlines are missed.
File attachments and comments will also be allowed for each task to support
seamless collaboration.
Employees will be grouped into teams or departments, and they will be added or
removed by Admins or Managers. Custom roles within each group will be assigned
based on operational needs. Task boards will be created per group, and shared
responsibilities will be managed collaboratively. Group membership changes and
task updates will be logged for transparency.
A chat feature will be incorporated to facilitate both group and private
communication. All chats will be stored securely, and they will be made accessible to
the Admin if monitoring is required. The ability to view or review conversations will be
granted to Admins in accordance with company policy. Message deletion, media
sharing, and real-time notifications will be supported, while usage reports and
flagged messages will be generated for administrative review.
A dashboard will be provided for all users. For Admins, performance metrics, task
completion rates, employee activity, and communication summaries will be
displayed. Employees will be shown their personal progress, upcoming deadlines,
and task history. These insights will be generated in real-time and will be exportable
for further analysis.
A complete employee directory will be maintained, where profile information such as
role, department, contact details, and assigned tasks will be stored. The directory will
be searchable to enable easier collaboration and task delegation among colleagues.

System notifications will be triggered automatically for events such as new task
assignments, upcoming deadlines, and important chat messages. Daily or weekly
summaries will be delivered to users to keep them informed of their responsibilities.
From the Admin panel, employees will be added, removed, or reassigned as
required. User promotions or demotions will be carried out through a secure
interface. Chat logs, audit trails, and system activity reports will be accessed by
Admins whenever needed for compliance or evaluation purposes. Security protocols
and role-based data restrictions will be enforced throughout the application to ensure
organizational data is protected.
